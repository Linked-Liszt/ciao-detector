## Image Classification Scripts
These scripts are stolen from a previous class project. To use the scripts create a dataset folder under `datasets` i.e. `datasets/demo_dataset`. Then, under the dataset folder create a `training` and `test` folder. Under that folder, you can create whatever classes are needed, for example `datasets/demo_dataset/test/dogs` and `datasets/demo_dataset/training/cats`. The pytorch imageloader will automatically pick up the classes.
